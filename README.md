# DesignPatterns-DesignPrinciples-SOLID
This project shows how to apply the design principles SOLID by using some design patterns that are based on OOP concepts in order to write clean code that is maintainable, extensible and testable.

I will go through the SOLID principles and apply some design patterns while I am working on this project. The project will be about Conversion System which converts a decimal number to Binary System, Octal System or Hexadecimal system.
