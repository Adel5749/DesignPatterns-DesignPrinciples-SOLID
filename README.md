# DesignPatterns-DesignPrinciples-SOLID
This project shows how to apply the design principles SOLID by using some design patterns that are based on OOP concepts in order to write clean code that is maintainable, extensible and testable.

I will go through the SOLID principles and apply some design patterns while I am working on this project. The project will be about Conversion System which converts a decimal number to Binary System, Octal System or Hexadecimal system.

The most famous design principles are called SOLID whcich decribe 5 principles as following:

S: Single Responsibility Principle: Classes should have a single responsibility and thus only a single reason to change.
   We use this principle to make our code more understandable, maintainable and testable.
   
O: Open-Closed Principle: Our code should be open for extension and closed for modifications.
   We use this principle to make our code more maintainable and more extensible.
   
L: Liskov Substitution Principle: The subtypes shoud act as the basetypes.

I: Interfaces Segregation Principle: The large interface could have some methods that the classes does not implement it which means that 
    we should use this principle to make the code more coherent and not violate the Liskov Substitution principle.
    
D: Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions. Abstraction should not depend on details, details should depend on abstractions. This principle makes the code more understandable, maintainable and testable and aims to loose coupling.
